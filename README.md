Graceful degradation and serviceWorkers are related because they both pertain to building web applications that can last. With graceful degradation, we keep having to maintain the versions so that the latest updates can still be run reliably on older versions. I think that serviceWorkers makes this better because it also improves performance, since it can handle stuff offline as well. Since both of them try to minimize the end user having to deal with errors, both of them are related.
